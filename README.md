# Wordpress into Laravel Valet Driver

Valet Driver for Wordpress in a Laravel subfolder

## When do I need this?
If you have a Wordpress installation put directly into the `public` subdirectory of a Laravel app and you're using Valet as a development environment, you need this.

## Installation
Put `WordpressIntoLaravelValetDriver.php` into `~/.valet/Drivers` or copy it as `LocalValetDriver.php` in your site directory.

Customize the `$subdirectory` variable with your own sudirectory name.

Have fun.
